### Hey, I'm Adam! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Honours Mathematics student at the University of Waterloo that deeply admires the possibilities of good code. I enjoy tackling problems related to both software development and data science! I primarily work with Python, C++, C, HTML, and CSS.

Iâ€™m currently an executive member at the UWaterloo Data Science Club as a Data Analyst. At the club, I utilize Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and BeautifulSoup4 to collect, organize, and visualize data relating to UWaterloo student interests.

Outside of programming, you can find me making infinitely many playlists on spotify!!

If youâ€™re interested in reaching out, please feel free to contact me at a34han@uwaterloo.ca. Iâ€™m always open to learning something new!
